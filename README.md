# Kali-Windows-Splunk-Lab
Build and attack a home lab with Kali Linux, Windows, and Splunk for cybersecurity training. This repository provides a step-by-step guide to setting up VMs, generating attacks, and analyzing telemetry in Splunk—ideal for SOC analysts and cybersecurity enthusiasts to develop threat detection and monitoring skills.


Introduction
- I will walk you through setting up a home lab for cybersecurity learning and testing purposes. We will use Kali Linux to simulate attacker, Windows 10 Pro for target host, Procmon to detect abnormal changes, and finally Splunk for log analysis.

Preq

Enhanced technical skills through continuous learning and collaboration with senior technical staff. 

Projects 

Home Lab w/ VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Windows, and Splunk 

Hands-On Network Isolation/Monitoring- Reinforced importance of creating isolated secure environment. Learned how to set up internal networking for testing suspected malicious activities. 

Log Analysis and Querying in Splunk- Filtering, searching, and analyzing telemetry in Splunk built my foundation on how to use Splunk to identify unusual or malicious activity. 

Incident Simulation and Telemery Generation- Creating and executing attacks from Kali Linux against Windows (Nmap scans, msfvenom payloads, reverse shells) Vital for understanding attackers TTP. 

PeepingTom (https://github.com/FradleyJ/PeepingTom) – TCP/UDP Port Scanner – Python  

Network Protocols- I gained a deeper understanding of sockets, TCP/IPv4 protocols, canonical names, and domain names. Which will aid me in SOC environment for analyzing network traffic/identifying anomalies. 

Network Scanning/Enumeration Techniques- Port scanning is crucial in identifying open ports/potential vulnerabilities. Furthers my understanding of techniques Pen Testers/adversaries use when mapping attack surfaces or exfiltration(c2) 

Sockets Library- Deeper understanding of how connections between computers are made via sockets. The process in which to generate my own socket/ connection.
